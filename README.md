shinyTreeViewer
===============

This repository hosts a simple (phylogenetic) tree viewer which is based mainly on the R packages ape, phangorn and shiny. 
You can run shinyTreeViewer from inside R. You need to have installed recent versions of the ape, devtools, phangorn and shiny package.

    shiny::runGitHub('shinyTreeViewer', 'KlausVigo')

You can launch shinyTreeViewer directly via the [RStudio server](http://klash.shinyapps.io/shinyTreeViewer/).

The R_code tab gives you the R commands used for creating the plot. This allows you to to explore with different parameters or can be a starting point to create more sophisticated plots.
