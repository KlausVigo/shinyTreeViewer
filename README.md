shinyTreeViewer
===============

This repository hosts a simple tree viewer which is based mainly on the R packages ape, phangorn and shiny. 
You can run shinyTreeViewer from inside R. 

    shiny::runGitHub('shinyTreeViewer', 'KlausVigo')

or even via the [RStudio server](http://klash.shinyapps.io/shinyTreeViewer/)

The R_code tab gives you the R commands used for plotting the tree as a starting point for more sophisticated plots.
